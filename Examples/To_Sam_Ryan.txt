My code now works well with Sam's new code for the Garcia/Siewert examples. The new files are in 

Examples/Tools directory: These tools are designed to work with all the examples. The are wrappers that take the qmc_data structure from Sam's codes, apply the solvers, and compare the two Krylov solves to source iteration. Those things seem to be common to all the examples.

Garcia directory: The files here do the things that are unique to the Garcia/Siewert example. The codes here make the four tables which compare the QMC exit distributions to the ones in the Garcia/Siewert paper.

The Garcia_Scripts directory has scripts that make the tables of the relative errors. These tables take a long time to produce, so I do that as a batch process. When the run I'm doing now is finished I will move this into the Garcia directory.

The next steps are (1) better document the codes and (2) do one of the multigroup problems and make sure that the results are correct. In this case results means that the fluxes are right and that the convergence of the linear solvers is what we should expect.

Sam, please test the multigroup codes to make sure the operator is linear. The test I sent you for the Garcia/Siewert problem should do the job with very few changes.
