   abstract = {Monte Carlo calculations of k-eigenvalue problems are based on a power iteration procedure. To obtain correct results free of contamination from the initial guess for the fission distribution, it is imperative to determine when the iteration procedure has converged, so that a sufficient number of the initial batches are discarded prior to beginning the Monte Carlo tallies. In this paper, we examine the convergence behavior using both theory and numerical testing, demonstrating that k eff may converge before the fission distribution for problems with a high dominance ratio. Thus, it is necessary to assess convergence of both k eff and the fission distribution to obtain correct results. To this end, the Shannon entropy of the fission distribution has been found to be a highly effective means of characterizing convergence of the fission distribution. The latest version of MCNP5 includes new capabilities for computing and plotting the Shannon entropy of the fission distribution as an important new tool for assessing problem convergence. Examples of the application of this new tool are presented for a variety of practical criticality problems.},

   abstract = {A modern symbolic algebra computer program, MAPLE, is used to compute solutions to the well-known analytical discrete ordinates, or S N , solutions in one-dimensional, slab geometry. Symbolic algebra programs compute the solutions with arbitrary precision and are free of spatial discretization error so they can be used to investigate new discretizations for one-dimensional slab, geometry S N methods. Pointwise scalar flux solutions are computed for several sample calculations of interest. Sample MAPLE command scripts are provided to illustrate how easily the theory can be translated into a working solution and serve as a complete tool capable of computing analytical S N solutions for mono-energetic, one-dimensional transport problems. #},

   abstract = {In discrete-ordinates (SN) simulations of large problems involving linear interactions between radiation and matter, the underlying linear Boltzmann problem is discretized and the resulting system of algebraic equations is solved iteratively. If the physical system contains subregions that are optically thick with small absorption, the simplest iterative process, Source Iteration, is inefficient and costly. During the past 40 years, significant progress has been achieved in the development of acceleration methods that speed up the iterative convergence of these problems. This progress consists of (i) a theory to derive the acceleration strategies, (ii) a theory to predict the convergence properties of the new strategies, and (iii) the implementation of these concepts in production computer codes, In this Review we discuss the theoretical foundations of this work, the important results that have been accomplished, and remaining open questions. 0 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Solving particle transport problems with the Monte Carlo method is simple - just simulate the particle behavior. The devil is in the details, however. This course provides a balanced approach to the theory and practice of Monte Carlo simulation codes, with lectures on transport, random number generation, random sampling, computational geometry, collision physics, tallies, statistics, eigenvalue calculations, variance reduction, and parallel algorithms. This is not a course in how to use MCNP or any other code, but rather provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental methods used in all modern Monte Carlo particle transport codes. The course content is suitable for beginners and code users, and includes much advanced material of interest to code developers. (10 lectures, 2 hrs each)},

   abstract = {The Monte Carlo (MC) method is the most accurate method for resolving radiative heat transfer in participating media. However, it is also computationally prohibitive in large-scale simulations. To alleviate this, this study proposes a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method for thermal radiation in participating media with a focus on combustion-related problems. The QMC method employs low-discrepancy sequences (LDS) in place of the traditional random numbers. Three different low-discrepancy sequences – Sobol, Halton, and Niederreiter – were examined as part of this work. The developed QMC method was first validated against analytical solutions of radiative heat transfer in several one-dimensional configurations. Then it was extended to three-dimensional practical combustion configurations. The results from QMC and traditional Monte Carlo are compared against benchmark solutions for each cases. It is shown that the error of the predicted radiation field from QMC is lower than an equivalent MC simulation. The computational cost of QMC was also found lower than MC due to the avoidance of requirement of several statistical runs for traditional Monte Carlo methods alongside achieving the reduction in error. In conclusion, significant improvements in computational costs and accuracy seen in the QMC method makes it an attractive alternative to traditional Monte Carlo methods in high-fidelity simulations.},

Our goal is to better understand the accuracy and performance characteristics of TRRM on massive scale problems, and to provide community software that facilitates further algorithmic development and potentially its application to a broader class of problems. Key features of ARRC include extreme memory efficiency, domain decomposition, a task based parallel structure, and the ability to efficiently utilize Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vector units. These attributes lead to efficient performance on modern high performance computer (HPC) architectures, enabling the detailed simulation of reactor cores in three dimensions.},

In this study, TRRM is developed and then tested on a series of exemplar reactor physics benchmark problems. The results show extreme improvements in memory efficiency compared to deterministic MOC methods, while also reducing algorithmic complexity, allowing for a sparser computational grid to be used while maintaining accuracy.},

   abstract = {A loss in the effectiveness of diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) schemes has been observed with certain S N discretizations on two-dimensional Cartesian grids in the presence of material disconti-nuities. We will present more evidence supporting the conjecture that DSA effectiveness will degrade for multidimensional problems with discontinuous total cross sections, regardless of the particular physical configuration or spatial discretization. Fourier analysis and numerical experiments help us identify a set of representative problems for which established DSA schemes are ineffective, focusing on diffusive problems for which DSA is most needed. We consider a lumped, linear discontinuous spatial discretization of the S N transport equation on three-dimensional, unstructured tetrahedral meshes and look at a fully consistent and a "partially consistent" DSA method for this discretization. The effectiveness of both methods is shown to degrade significantly. A Fourier analysis of the fully consistent DSA scheme in the limit of decreasing cell optical thickness supports the view that the DSA itself is failing when material discontinuities are present in a problem. We show that a Krylov iterative method, preconditioned with DSA, is an effective remedy that can be used to efficiently compute solutions for this class of problems. We show that as a preconditioner to the Krylov method, a partially consistent DSA method is more than adequate. In fact, it is preferable to a fully consistent method because the partially consistent method is based on a continuous finite element discretization of the diffusion equation that can be solved relatively easily. The Krylov method can be implemented in terms of the original S N source iteration coding with only slight modification. Results from numerical experiments show that replacing source iteration with a preconditioned Krylov method can efficiently solve problems that are virtually intractable with accelerated source iteration.},
